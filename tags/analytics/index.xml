      <description>Do you love Alteryx but have already complex SQL queries that you would like to use as your input data?
Alteryx is great and it is usually my go to point when I need to manipulate data. However, in the team we also use SQL quite often, for instance, there are some pre-defined queries that make it easier for us to get the output we want.
In some cases, I want to develop further manipulation or analysis on those tables connecting them directly to Alteryx.</description>

      <description>I have being using R since I was at uni and I did recently discovered how to sync it with Github for version control of projects which is making my life much easier.
I love being to have a version control of my project. Moreover, I can use any computer to work on my app which is giving me a lot of flexibility.
There are obviuosly other tool as Google Drive, One Drive&amp;hellip;that you can use to save your work through laptops but I just find the integration of R with Github very handy.</description>

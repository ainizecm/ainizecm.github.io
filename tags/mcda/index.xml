      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)  Every novel approach borns when you think differently, when you don&amp;rsquo;t let contrains frame a project and when you are passionate about what you are trying to achive.
In this case, starting with no previous knowledge on the solution of the problem and having a great mentor were the bigest factors to develop a new approach. A novel mind is usually more likely to think out of the box and with good guidance it can lead to great things.</description>

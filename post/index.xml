      <description>I have being using R since I was at uni and I did recently discovered how to sync it with Github for version control of projects which is making my life much easier.

There are obviuosly other tool as Google Drive, One Drive&amp;hellip;that you can use to save your work through laptops but I just find the integration of R with Github very handy.</description>

      <description>I have being using R since I was at uni and I did recently discovered how to sync it with Github for version control of projects which is making my life much easier.
I love being to have a version control of my project. Moreover, I can use any computer to work on my app which is giving me a lot of flexibility.
There are obviuosly other tool as Google Drive, One Drive&amp;hellip;that you can use to save your work through laptops but I just find the integration of R with Github very handy.</description>

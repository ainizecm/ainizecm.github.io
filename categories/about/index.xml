      <description>Hello world!
I am Ainize, Commercial Analyst in Global during the day and Consultant for ISGlobal at night. I am passionate about analytics, decision making, data, frameworks and having an impact through numbers. And that is what I will be writing about.
Bilbao, Utrecht, Barcelona, Chicago and London are how I would describe my career so far. Each city has given me something different and special, not only at a professional level.</description>
